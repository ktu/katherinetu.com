<p>My name is Katherine Tu. I recently graduated with a Master's degree in rhetoric at the University of Waterloo. I did my Bachelor's in computer science. My time as a graduate student has allowed me to work with the <a href="https://artsresearch.uwaterloo.ca/chiastic/display/index.php">University of Waterloo's RhetFig group</a>, headed by <a href="http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~raha/">Professor Randy Allen Harris</a>, which aims to study the intersection between rhetorical figures and other domains, including computer science. </p>

<p>Outside of rhetorical figures, I am interested in linguistics, computational linguistics, and natural languages.</p>
